<p><strong>
  Welcome to the GA4GH Demo of GA4GH Passports and attribute-based access control.
</strong></p>
<p>
  The Data Discovery and Access Platform provides researchers access to data provided by data hosts.
  Researchers can bring their own identities from various identity providers and aggregate
  <a href="http://bit.ly/ga4gh-passport-v1#ga4gh-passport" target="_blank">GA4GH Passports</a>
  from these accounts to meet access criteria for these research datasets.
</p>
<p class="playground" class="hide">
  This <strong>Playground Edition</strong> of the platform can be used for testing of claims by allowing users to log
  in using Test Persona accounts. These test persona accounts can be modified to assert different Identity Claims and then be used to
  test data access against policies that check those claims.
  <strong>Only for use with synthetic and public datasets.</strong>
