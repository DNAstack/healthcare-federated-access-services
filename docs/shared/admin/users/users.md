# User Administration

## Overview

Users of the system are registered at the time they sign in. This list of users
is available to system administrators to:

1. Help troubleshoot issues that users may have.
1. Conduct audits on system usage.
1. Resolve security issues with a user account.
1. To conduct account system management, such as removing unused accounts or
   conducting wipeout requests from a user.

## Account Management for System Administrators

1. **Search for user accounts**: Visit the `users` page and use the search tool
   to find the appropriate user account. For example, you may search by account
   identifier, user name, or other related account properties.

1. **Open a user account**: From the search results list, select a user to see
   their profile or use menus to get access to the user's sessions, logs, and
   consents.
   *  The interface provides the administrator with the same account management
      interface that users interact with when managing their own accounts.
   *  There are a few differences on the [profile
      page](../../account/profile.md):
      *  The administrator is able to toggle the `disabled` account feature.
      *  The adminstrator is **not** able to link accounts on behalf of the
         user.
