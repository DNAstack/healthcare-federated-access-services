# User Account Management

## Overview

The Data Access Manager (DAM) and Identity Concentrator (IC) services both offer
a set of user account management features. Click on one of the following feature
areas to get more information:

1. **[Account Profile](profile.md)**: view and edit the profile information that
   is shared about you between various systems involved.
   *  This information is requested and sent between biomedical services your
      account interacts with.
   *  Systems will ask for your permission to release this information.
   *  You can use the [Remembered Consents](consents.md) feature such that you
      are not prompted each time you sign in to release this information to the
      services you are interacting with.

1. **[User Sessions](sessions.md)**: view a list of recent sign-in sessions that
   your user account has initiated with various services that use your account
   permissions to perform work on your behalf.
   *  See which services have sessions active for your account.
   *  Revoke sessions when you feel a service should no longer be using your
      account to perform work.

1. **[Remembered Consents](consents.md)**: view and remove `Remembered Consents`
   such that you will be prompted again for permission to release information.

1. **[Audit Logs](logs.md)**: view usage and status logs for audit purposes.
   *  Know how your account sessions have been used recently on various
      service requests.
   *  Get access to status details and diagnostic information when errors
      occur.
   *  Follow up with suspicious behavior should you suspect that your account
      is being used in ways you wouldn't expect.
